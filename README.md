## 🎯 Objective
Capture live network packets using Wireshark, identify basic protocols, and summarize the findings.

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. **Installed Wireshark** (v4.4.9, 64-bit) on Windows.
2. **Started live capture** on the active Wi-Fi interface.
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and pinging a server.
4. Stopped capture after ~1 minute.
5. Applied filters such as:
   - `tcp`
   - `dns`
   - `http`
6. Identified and analyzed at least 3 different protocols.

## 📊 Protocols Identified
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – reliable, connection-oriented data transfer.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** – used for resolving domain names to IP addresses.
- **TLSv1.2 (Transport Layer Security)** – encryption protocol used by HTTPS websites.
